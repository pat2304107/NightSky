# Night Sky

Night Sky is a small Vite-powered web experience that turns your input into a starry scene. Type a number, press **Enter**, and watch the sky fill with stars followed by a short romantic line. Use **Retry** to clear the sky and start again.

## Features

- Animated star creation based on the number you enter.
- Lightweight, dependency-free frontend (just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
- Quick reset to try different star counts.

- Node.js 18+ (or any version compatible with Vite 7).
